# HealthTrack
HealthTrack is a comprehensive system designed to streamline hospital patient care management. It effectively handles both inpatient and outpatient care, providing tools for observation status assessment, financial analysis, and insurance integration to support informed decision-making and optimal treatment delivery.


## Introduction

Within the framework of hospital systems, patient care can be broadly categorized into two main streams: inpatient and outpatient care. Each stream caters to distinct medical needs and treatment modalities, shaping the approach to healthcare delivery.

Inpatient care encapsulates individuals who require extended stays within a hospital setting, often undergoing intricate procedures or facing severe health conditions that demand continuous monitoring and treatment. Complex surgeries, critical illnesses, childbirth, and severe injuries constitute scenarios where patients fall under the umbrella of inpatient care. Conversely, outpatient care represents services that do not necessitate hospitalization, enabling patients to receive required treatments or procedures externally without a prolonged hospital stay.

One of the pivotal tasks for physicians lies in determining the observation status of a patient, evaluating the necessity of hospitalization. This assessment period typically spans no more than 24 hours and significantly influences subsequent care decisions. Outpatient care encompasses a spectrum of services ranging from diagnostic procedures like X-rays, MRIs, CT-scans, and lab tests to routine physical exams and radiation treatments.

A notable divergence between inpatient and outpatient care surfaces in their financial implications. Inpatient care often incurs additional facility-based fees, whereas outpatient care primarily involves fees associated with doctors and conducted tests. The cost disparities within healthcare services, as reflected in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, elucidate the variance in average inpatient charges contingent upon treatment duration and complexity. However, the precise financial impact is subject to the terms outlined by insurance providers.

Understanding the nuances between these care models not only aids in providing optimal treatment but also elucidates the financial landscape of healthcare services, contributing to informed decision-making for both patients and healthcare providers.

## Data Description 

The foundation of this project's analysis lies in data collected from the Medicare Inpatient Hospitals by Geography and Service for the year 2021. The dataset comprises essential categories for both inpatient and outpatient care, offering a detailed perspective on healthcare services and their financial implications.
